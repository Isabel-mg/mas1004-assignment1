"""Build a model and train it. YOU write the bodies of these functions.

The model is ResNet18, a convolutional network that was already trained on
ImageNet, 1.2 million photographs of 1,000 kinds of thing. You keep everything
it learned there and replace only its last layer, so that it answers with your
categories instead of those 1,000. Then you train it further on your images.

Run `pytest tests/test_train.py` after you fill them in. The first run
downloads the ImageNet weights, about 45 MB.

        "train_acc"   the share of training rows the model got right in those
                      batches, between 0.0 and 1.0
        "test_loss"   the mean loss over the test set, measured after the epoch
        "test_acc"    the share of the test set it gets right, measured after
                      the epoch, between 0.0 and 1.0

    What to do
        Use a GPU when there is one:
            device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        Move the model there once, and each batch there as you use it. Keep
        X_train and X_test themselves in ordinary memory: they may not fit on
        the GPU.
        Shuffle the training rows again at the start of every epoch.
        Use nn.CrossEntropyLoss, which expects raw outputs, and torch.optim.Adam
        over the parameters that have requires_grad set.
        Call model.train() before the training batches and model.eval() before
        measuring the test set. ResNet contains BatchNorm layers, which behave
        differently in the two modes.
        Do not compute gradients while measuring the test set, and never let
        the test rows change the parameters.
        Print one line per epoch, so that you can watch it while it runs.

    The model is trained in place. When this function returns, `model` is the
    trained one, and it is left on the device it was trained on.
